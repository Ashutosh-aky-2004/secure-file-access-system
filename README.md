This project is a lightweight and responsive web-based file management interface designed for admin use. It provides core functionalities such as viewing, editing, and deleting files through a user-friendly dashboard. The system ensures a smooth user experience by dynamically updating the UI without the need for full page reloads. For example, when an admin deletes a file, the system automatically clears the file editor section, displays a "No file selected" message, and refreshes the list of available files in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.

The interface is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to handle dynamic front-end interactions. Backend operations like file deletion, retrieval, or saving can be handled using PHP, Node.js, or any preferred server-side language. The modular code structure makes it easy to integrate into existing content management systems (CMS), admin dashboards, or internal tools where file manipulation is required.

This project is ideal for developers who need a simple and extendable solution for basic file operations, while maintaining a clean and efficient user interface. Additional features like user authentication, file upload, version history, or role-based access can be easily incorporated as needed.
